Optical photon ray tracing program for crystal studies. 

There are two main classes: Photon and Plane.

Crystal geometry is defined by a set of convex polygon surfaces (Planes).

Each Plane is defined by a list of corners. Each corner is an numpy.array
of three elements. Corners in the list must be in order (clockwise or counter-
clockwise). The angle at each corner must be less than 180 degrees (convex). 
One can define properties of each surface such as reflectivity.

Photon has its position and direction, as well as other properties, such as
mean free path.

A Photon travels inside the crystal and reflects at the surfaces, until it
is killed either at the surface (reflectivity) or after certain path length
(mean free path).
