{"name":"Pycrysray","tagline":"Internal ray trace for crystals","body":"=== Project pycrysray: ===\r\n\r\nOptical photon ray tracing program for crystal studies. \r\n\r\nThere are two main classes: Photon and Plane.\r\n\r\nCrystal geometry is defined by a set of convex polygon surfaces (Planes).\r\n\r\nEach Plane is defined by a list of corners. Each corner is an numpy.array\r\nof three elements. Corners in the list must be in order (clockwise or counter-\r\nclockwise). The angle at each corner must be less than 180 degrees (convex). \r\nOne can define properties of each surface such as reflectivity.\r\n\r\nPhoton has its position and direction, as well as other properties, such as\r\nmean free path.\r\n\r\nA Photon travels inside the crystal and reflects at the surfaces, until it\r\nis killed either at the surface (reflectivity) or after certain path length\r\n(mean free path).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
